        <h6 class="text-center">(because you go to a UC that claims their students would never find it difficult to register for "small" classes with 1000+ students?)</h4> 
        <h3>Well we're here to help!</h3>
        <h4>Select a UC campus that you attend. Go to its registration page separate from this page and find the course number of the class you'd like to register for. Fill in the respective information for the class. Select a means of contacting you (email or text or both) that you'd like us to contact you through to receive a notification that your class is finally open. You will receive a notification every so often to ensure that the program is running. Once you confirm your class and contact info, a browser will pop up. DO NOT CLOSE THE BROWSER THAT OPENS UP TO SEARCH THROUGH THE CLASSES! So don't worry, sit back and relax. You'll be notified when the class of your choice is open without having to continuously refresh the page and check it yourself. Once someone drops the class, you'll be notified so you can enroll in it. </h4>
