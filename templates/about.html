  <h1>The Coders</h1>

  <p>Hey, this is Eileen and I'm the one who
    worked on the front end. I like squares. They're like my trademark.
    <span title="sorry i just worked too hard on this ;-;">Check out the <a href="home_copy.html" target="_blank">beta page.</span></a><br>
    I used Bootstrap to enhance my CSS and HTML, as well
    as jQuery for my JavaScript. I also assisted in some Python on the backend.


  </p>

  <p>My partner Anastasia worked on the back end, namely making the program run
    in the background and automatically go to the website and input the data.
    Basically, the cool stuff.
    <br>Anastasia used Python.</p>
    <p>Yeah, I'm too lazy to make this page all fancy. I'm tired of
      HTML and CSS right now.</p>

<br><br><br>

<p style="color:red">Psst, Anastasia, you should put why you wanted to make this app,
  and the purpose of this app.</p>
