  <h1>The Coders</h1>

  <p>Hey, this is Eileen and I'm the one who
    worked on the front end. So, all these squares upon squares
    are because of me. <span title="see my other works and you'll agree">
    They're like my trademark.</span><br>
    I used Bootstrap to enhance my CSS and HTML, as well
    as jQuery for my JavaScript.


  </p>

  <p>My partner Anastasia worked on the back end, namely making the program run
    in the background and automatically go to the website and input the data.
    Basically, the cool stuff.
    <br>Anastasia used <span title="and AJAX/JSON when we figure out how to do it">Java.</span></p>
    <p>Yeah, I'm too lazy to make this page all fancy. I'm tired of
      HTML and CSS right now.</p>

<br><br><br>

<p style="color:red">Psst, Anastasia, you should put why you wanted to make this app,
  and the purpose of this app.</p>
