  <p>Hey this is Eileen and I'm the one who
    worked on the front end. So, all these squares
    are because of me. They're like my trademark.</span>

  </p>

  <p>My partner Anastasia worked on the back end, namely making the program run
    in the background and all the cool stuff.</p>

    <p>Yeah I'm too lazy to make this page all fancy. I'm tired of
      HTML and CSS right now. Graphic design isn't my strongest point, but someone's got to do it.</span></p>
