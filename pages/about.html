  <h1>The Coders</h1>

  <p>Hey, this is Eileen and I'm the one who
    worked on the front end. So, all these squares upon squares
    are because of me. They're like my trademark.<br>
    I used Bootstrap to enhance my CSS and HTML, as well
    as jQuery for my JavaScript.


  </p>

  <p>My partner Anastasia worked on the back end, namely making the program run
    in the background and automatically go to the website and input the data.
    Basically, the cool stuff.
    <br>Anastasia used Java.</p>

    <p>Yeah, I'm too lazy to make this page all fancy. I'm tired of
      HTML and CSS right now. Graphic design isn't my strongest point, but someone's got to do it.</span></p>
